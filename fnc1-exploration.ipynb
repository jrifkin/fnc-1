    "# Overview\n",
    "The goal of the Fake News Challenge is to explore how artificial intelligence technologies, particularly machine learning and natural language processing, might be leveraged to combat the fake news problem. We believe that these AI technologies hold promise for significantly automating parts of the procedure human fact checkers use today to determine if a story is real or a hoax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assessing the veracity of a news story is a complex and cumbersome task, even for trained experts 3. Fortunately, the process can be broken down into steps or stages. A helpful first step towards identifying fake news is to understand what other news organizations are saying about the topic. We believe automating this process, called Stance Detection, could serve as a useful building block in an AI-assisted fact-checking pipeline. So stage 1 of the Fake News Challenge (FNC-1) focuses on the task of Stance Detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stance Detection involves estimating the relative perspective (or stance) of two pieces of text relative to a topic, claim or issue. The version of Stance Detection we have selected for FNC-1 extends the work of Ferreira & Vlachos 4. For FNC-1 we have chosen the task of estimating the stance of a body text from a news article relative to a headline. Specifically, the body text may agree, disagree, discuss or be unrelated to the headline.\n",

    "# Formal definition\n",

    "```\n",
    "Input\n",
    "    A headline and a body text - either from the same news article or from two different articles.\n",
    "Output\n",
    "    Classify the stance of the body text relative to the claim made in the headline into one of four categories:\n",
    "        Agrees: The body text agrees with the headline.\n",
    "        Disagrees: The body text disagrees with the headline.\n",
    "        Discusses: The body text discuss the same topic as the headline, but does not take a position\n",
    "        Unrelated: The body text discusses a different topic than the headline\n",

       "      <td>A small meteorite crashed into a wooded area in Nicaragua's capital of Managua overnight, the government said Sunday. Residents reported hearing a mysterious boom that left a 16-foot deep crater near the city's airport, the Associated Press reports. \\n\\nGovernment spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a \"relatively small\" meteorite that \"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.\" House-sized asteroid 2014 RC, which measured 60 feet in diameter, skimmed the Earth this weekend, ABC News reports. \\nMurillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.\\n\\nThe crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet,  said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.\\n\\nHumberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.\\n\\n\"We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,\" he said.\\n\\nWilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was \"very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.\"\\n\\nLocal residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.\\n\\n\"I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,\" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.\\n\\nThe site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit it.</td>\n",

Two Australians say they bought a few McDonald's burgers for friends back in 1995, when they were teens, and one of the friends never showed up. So the kid's burger went uneaten—and stayed that way, Australia's News Network reports. \"We’re pretty sure it’s the oldest burger in the world,\" says one of the men, Casey Dean. Holding onto the burger for their friend \"started off as a joke,\" he adds, but \"the months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.\"\\n\\nDean and his burger-buying mate, Eduard Nitz, even took the burger on Australian TV show The Project last night and \"showed off the mold-free specimen,\" News 9 reports. The pair offered to take a bite of it for charity but were dissuaded by the show's hosts. They've also started a Facebook page for the burger called \"Can This 20 Year Old Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?\" that has more than 4,044 likes as of this writing. And they're selling an iTunes song, \"Free the Burger,\" for $1.69, and giving proceeds to the charity Beyond Blue, which helps Australians battle anxiety and depression. (A few years ago, a man sold a 20-year-old bottle of McDonald's McJordan sauce for $10,000. Here's why Mickey D's food seemingly never decays.)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Posting photos of a gun-toting child online, ISIS supporters announced that the group’s youngest soldier has died in combat.\\n\\nTwitter accounts linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham claimed that the child soldier “got martyred” with his father while fighting for the terrorist group in Syria.\\n\\nPhotos posted on Twitter showed the smiling boy in military fatigues holding weapons that, at times, are almost as large as his body. British media reported that the child was roughly 10 years old.\\n\\nThe photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors ISIS social media for the London-based Quilliam counter-extremism think tank.\\nIn the past week, Mr. Cooper has noticed the hashtag “shibal_alBaghdadi” — which translates as “the cub of Baghdadi” — on Twitter accounts linked to ISIS.\\n\\nWhile ISIS fighters commonly refer to themselves as lions of the Islamic State, Mr. Cooper said, they refer to child soldiers as cubs of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, ISIS’s self-proclaimed caliph.\\n\\nAbu Ubaidah, the youngest fighter in the Islamic State got martyred with his father by US airstrikes 2 weeks ago. #IS http://t.co/N1PUeXI7iR\\n\\n— \\nIslamic State Times (@ISTimes1) October 07, 2014\\nMr. Cooper first saw ISIS supporters tweeting that the young boy was dead on Sept. 26. And while he says social media often produces fabricated reports to make ISIS seem “more brutal than it is,” the reports of the dead child appear to be coming directly from ISIS. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. air strike, though that has not been confirmed.\\n\\nISIS supporters identified the boy as Abu Ubaidah.\\n\\n“It seems like a very legitimate thing,” Mr. Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that ISIS is known to use child soldiers. “I would vouch for it.”\\n\\nA United Nations report on Iraq this month said children conduct patrols for ISIS, arrest and guard prisoners, carry weapons and are forced to give blood to help injured fighters. While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said child soldiers with ISIS are as young 12 and 13 years old.\\nChildren are also frequently used in ISIS propaganda, with photos showing children in “uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media,” the UN reported.\\n\\n“Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by ISIS,” said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.\\n\\n“If we [Canada] send boots on the ground, we’re going to see this face to face,” she said.\\n\\nCurrently, the six-month Canadian mission in Iraq will be limited to air strikes, with a ban on deploying any combat troops on the ground.</td>\n",

The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive.\\n\\nA member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, “Two of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.”\\n\\nSeparately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa.\\n\\nTada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain.\\n\\n“My brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children,” he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone.\\n\\n“They [the militants] came yesterday [Sunday] while people were scouting for food at the foot of the mountain.

Residents reported hearing a mysterious boom that left a 16-foot deep crater near the city's airport, the Associated Press reports. \\n\\nGovernment spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a \"relatively small\" meteorite that \"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.\" House-sized asteroid 2014 RC, which measured 60 feet in diameter, skimmed the Earth this weekend, ABC News reports. \\nMurillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.\\n\\nThe crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet,  said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.\\n\\nHumberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.\\n\\n\"We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,\" he said.\\n\\nWilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was \"very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.\"\\n\\nLocal residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.\\n\\n\"I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,\" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.\\n\\nThe site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit it.  \n",

Two Australians say they bought a few McDonald's burgers for friends back in 1995, when they were teens, and one of the friends never showed up. So the kid's burger went uneaten—and stayed that way, Australia's News Network reports. \"We’re pretty sure it’s the oldest burger in the world,\" says one of the men, Casey Dean. Holding onto the burger for their friend \"started off as a joke,\" he adds, but \"the months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.\"\\n\\nDean and his burger-buying mate, Eduard Nitz, even took the burger on Australian TV show The Project last night and \"showed off the mold-free specimen,\" News 9 reports. The pair offered to take a bite of it for charity but were dissuaded by the show's hosts. They've also started a Facebook page for the burger called \"Can This 20 Year Old Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?\" that has more than 4,044 likes as of this writing. And they're selling an iTunes song, \"Free the Burger,\" for $1.69, and giving proceeds to the charity Beyond Blue, which helps Australians battle anxiety and depression.

British media reported that the child was roughly 10 years old.\\n\\nThe photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors ISIS social media for the London-based Quilliam counter-extremism think tank.\\nIn the past week, Mr. Cooper has noticed the hashtag “shibal_alBaghdadi” — which translates as “the cub of Baghdadi” — on Twitter accounts linked to ISIS.\\n\\nWhile ISIS fighters commonly refer to themselves as lions of the Islamic State, Mr. Cooper said, they refer to child soldiers as cubs of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, ISIS’s self-proclaimed caliph.\\n\\nAbu Ubaidah, the youngest fighter in the Islamic State got martyred with his father by US airstrikes 2 weeks ago. #IS http://t.co/N1PUeXI7iR\\n\\n— \\nIslamic State Times (@ISTimes1) October 07, 2014\\nMr. Cooper first saw ISIS supporters tweeting that the young boy was dead on Sept. 26. And while he says social media often produces fabricated reports to make ISIS seem “more brutal than it is,” the reports of the dead child appear to be coming directly from ISIS. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. air strike, though that has not been confirmed.\\n\\nISIS supporters identified the boy as Abu Ubaidah.\\n\\n“It seems like a very legitimate thing,” Mr. Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that ISIS is known to use child soldiers. “I would vouch for it.”\\n\\nA United Nations report on Iraq this month said children conduct patrols for ISIS, arrest and guard prisoners, carry weapons and are forced to give blood to help injured fighters. While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said child soldiers with ISIS are as young 12 and 13 years old.\\nChildren are also frequently used in ISIS propaganda, with photos showing children in “uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media,” the UN reported.\\n\\n“Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by ISIS,” said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.\\n\\n“If we [Canada] send boots on the ground, we’re going to see this face to face,” she said.\\n\\nCurrently, the six-month Canadian mission in Iraq will be limited to air strikes, with a ban on deploying any combat troops on the ground.  \n",

The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive.\\n\\nA member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, “Two of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.”\\n\\nSeparately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa.\\n\\nTada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain.\\n\\n“My brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children,” he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone.\\n\\n“They [the militants] came yesterday [Sunday] while people were scouting for food at the foot of the mountain. When the insurgents sighted our people, they pursued them and slaughtered five,” Tada said.  "
